Configuration notes:
* copy the system-gnetlistrc file to ~/.gEDA/gnetlistrc, comment (insert semi;colon) out the line that reads:
  (hierarchy-netattrib-mangle "enabled")
and uncomment remove semi-colon the line that reads
  ;(hierarchy-netattrib-mangle "disabled")
The resulting lines should look like this:
  ;(hierarchy-netattrib-mangle "enabled")
  (hierarchy-netattrib-mangle "disabled")
This allows power and ground rails to be routed between schematics without mangling the names.

* set the Library path in PCB to point to the local footprints folder.  Use File->Preferences->Library in PCB to do this.
