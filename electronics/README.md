# Buildbotics Machine Controller Schematics & PCB Layout
The top-level schematic is in the file ``buildbotics_controller.sch``.  To view
and edit the schematics run:

    make schematics

You must have ``make`` and the GEDA tools install.  Other make commands are:

  * ``pcb`` - Open the PCB editor.
  * ``bom`` - Create a Bill of Materials file in ``buildbotics_controller.bom``.
  * ``allegro`` - Craete an Allegro netlist file.
  * ``layout`` - Initialize the PCB layout.
  * ``attrib`` - Edit schematic part attributes.
  * ``zip`` - Create a zip file from the Gerber and drill files.
  * ``clean`` - Remove all autogenerated files.

# Configuration notes
Copy the ``system-gnetlistrc`` file to ``~/.gEDA/gnetlistrc``, comment out
(insert semi;colon) the line that reads:

    (hierarchy-netattrib-mangle "enabled")

and uncomment remove semi-colon the line that reads

    ;(hierarchy-netattrib-mangle "disabled")

The resulting lines should look like this:

    ;(hierarchy-netattrib-mangle "enabled")
    (hierarchy-netattrib-mangle "disabled")

This allows power and ground rails to be routed between schematics without
mangling the names.

Set the library path in PCB to point to the local footprints folder.  Use
``File->Preferences->Library`` in PCB to do this.
